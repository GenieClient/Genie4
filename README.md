<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Help
Look for help on the official Genie 3 discord server, here https://discord.com/channels/185383036563488768/492720689858740234/566398818732605465

### Prerequisites


Genie Client utilizes Microsoft .NET 6 Framework and you may need to install it.  
The Download can be pulled directly from the Microsoft website using the links below. 

Microsoft .NET Framework 6.0.1 Runtime [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0]

### Installation
Note that as the project develops, there will be a smoother installation procedure. For now, you are required to download compressed files that include core game executables and optional default script and plugin settings. What follows is the current actual installation procedure.

1. Download the compressed files of the client from here:
	https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie4/releases/

2. Copy the extracted client files into your desired install Location. 
   As an example,
   ```sh
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Genie Client 4
   ```
3. Get Maps Updates from the Team at
	[https://github.com/GenieClient/Maps]

4. Set up some optional settings
You can now do things like redirect your config files to your original Genie 3 location, or even set up Lich. 

#### Trouble
If you have trouble with any of this, please pop in to discord. Lots of folks are happy to help.
Also, if you try to launch Genie4 and nothing happens, try "Right Click" > "Run as Administrator"
